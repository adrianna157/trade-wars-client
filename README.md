[Intro]
(Won't you get out of my head?)
(Electrify my golden tooth)

[Verse 1]
Forget it, I'll do it sometime, ooh
I'm locked up on the button
Can't you do it sometime?
Pushed it in too far, oh

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Me plus you (I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
One time (one time) one time
