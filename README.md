[Intro]
(Won't you get out of my head?)
(Electrify my golden tooth)

[Verse 1]
Forget it, I'll do it sometime, ooh
I'm locked up on the button
Can't you do it sometime?
Pushed it in too far, oh

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Me plus you (I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
One time (one time) one time

They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down
