Sunday morning brings the dawn in
It's just a restless feeling by my side
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's just the wasted years so close behind

(Won't you get out of my head?)
(Electrify my golden tooth)

Forget it, I'll do it sometime, ooh
I'm locked up on the button
Can't you do it sometime?
Pushed it in too far, oh

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Me plus you (I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
One time (one time) one time

They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I want to jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like

Let's deck the halls with spots of Cheetah
Let's have some Christmas fun! Yea
If you wanna be, oh, a Christmas Cheetah
We can show you how it's done!
You be gotta be good
Cause Santa Clause knows
Helping all ya girls
Everywhere that you go
All around the world
Join us now and
Have yourself a very merry
